    "### Introduction\n",
    "The normal distribution is the most important and most widely used distribution in statistics and analytics. It is also called the \"bell curve,\" due to its shape or the \"Gaussian curve\" after the mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss. This shape results in plotting normally distributed data as a histogram. A smoothing function may be used to smooth the outer edges of distribution to achieve the said \"bell\" shape as shown below. "

    "### Measures of Center and Spread \n",
    "\n",
    "If you remember skewness, you would recognize there is no skew in a perfectly normal distribution.  It is **centered around its mean**.\n",

The key takeaway here is to understand that normal distributions can be defined, created, processed and visualized only using two parameters as shown above, mean and standard deviation (pi and e are the constants in this equation). \n",

    "### Normal Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "For now , we will identify normal distributions with following key characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Normal distributions are symmetric around their mean.\n",
    "* The mean, median, and mode of a normal distribution are equal.\n",
    "* The area under the bell curve is equal to 1.0.\n",
    "* Normal distributions are denser in the center and less dense in the tails.\n",
    "* Normal distributions are defined by two parameters, the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).\n",
    "* Around 68% of the area of a normal distribution is within one standard deviation of the mean \n",
    "(μ - σ to μ + σ)\n",
    "* Approximately 95% of the area of a normal distribution is within two standard deviations of the mean ((μ - 2σ to μ + 2σ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Above characteristics can be better visualized with a slightly more detailed description below. Here the spread is differentiated between different levels of deviation. If a value is found in the red region, it is termed as \"within 1 standard deviation\". Blue and green regions and 2 and 3 standard deviation away from mean respectively.\n",

    "This forms a 68-95-99.7 rule, i.e., 68% values of a normal distribution are within 1 standard deviation of mean, 95% within 2 standard deviations and 99.7 % within 3 standard deviations. So normally distributed data is considered ideal for analysis due to this simplicity of description. Values in the extreme of tails (3 sd+) can be considered \"interesting events\" as their probability of occurrence is less than usual. Or in some cases, you consider them as outliers due to noise or error of measurement. It all depends on your analysis question.  \n",
